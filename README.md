# Welcome to our craigslist-redesign repo!

In its existing design, Craigslist is a 90s themed website. User research shows that this design makes users wary of using Craigslist, citing it as "unsafe" or "sketchy." 

# Our Solution
We redesigned Craigslist to be more inviting and easy to navigate, yet as close to the feel of its original/current design.
