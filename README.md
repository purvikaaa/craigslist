# Welcome to our craigslist-redesign repo!

In its existing design, Craigslist is a 90s themed website. User research shows that this design makes users wary of using Craigslist, citing it as "unsafe" or "sketchy." 

# Our Solution
We redesigned Craigslist to be more inviting and easy to navigate, yet as close to the feel of its original/current design. Please see our Figma design here for more details: https://www.figma.com/file/HpMHu3QEgmjqsoTL2NZOgt/Craigslist-Redesign?node-id=2%3A4 .

# Where to start
I recommend going by file (start with html files and their corresponding css stylesheet located in css folder).

# Development
We deployed craigslist-redesign as a three page glimpse into what we think would enhance the Craigslist experience. This website was developed with HTML, CSS and Flickity JS slider library. Please see https://flickity.metafizzy.co/ for more information about Flickity.
